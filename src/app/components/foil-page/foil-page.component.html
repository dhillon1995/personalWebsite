                        This electric hydrofoil board is an ongoing project that I’ve been working on sporadically whenever I managed to get a chance. The idea is pretty straight forwards, there are already many e-foil board options on the market and they do their jobs pretty well, however this comes at a significant cost as the average price is between £8000 -£12000. This price bracket, for what is fundamentally a fairly simple concept, seems a little disingenuous so I decided to look into how difficult it would be to design and build one for myself and maybe some friends.

                        The construction of the board’s components would have to be incredibly light, stiff and corrosion resistant making composite materials a perfect choice. After doing extensive research and testing on this subject, I decided that the best materials and designs to use are; a hollow carbon fiber structure for the mast making it as thin and strong as possible to reduce drag through the water, forged carbon construction for the mast mount, the motor mount and the wing itself, and a fiberglass/aramid hybrid for the actual board to give it some deflection properties, making it more resistant to damage from small impacts against rocks and such.

                        <p>The wing itself needs to be able to provide enough lift to lift both your bodyweight and board, but it will also need to produce as little drag as possible while doing so. The less drag you have, the faster and more efficient your board can be. I used the NACA airfoil database to find some promising hydrofoil cross-sections. I then created test wings in CAD and plugged them into SIMSCALE to run CFD tests on. The results were good, with a clear difference in pressure zones meaning lift is present, with clean laminar flow along the surfaces. Further testing would have to be done with the final wing design both in CFD and in the real world, but these wings are ultimately interchangeable, so you can choose between long range glide wings or short and agile wings with quicker roll rates for carving.</p>
                        <p>The electronics of the board are actually the simplest part of this project, I can purchase a BLDC motor with a high voltage water cooled ESC, the motor is also externally passively cooled by flowing water. The battery for development will be some high discharge rated LiPo cells, but for the final version I intend on building a custom water proof lithium-Ion battery pack with Panasonic 18650 cells which are widely used in similar applications. This battery pack would have a charge and discharge controller, alongside a cell level fuse construction for the safest possible package. Finally, I would double insulate and make sure the battery pack is completely water proof.</p>

                        After completing some composite tests, I decided to begin the construction of the board with the mast. I created a negative mold for the mast and printed it out in sections, I still need to assemble the mold pieces using 2020 aluminum extrusions as the backbone of the mold, and then smooth the surface out for a perfect final finish. I'll use a resin infusion technique to fully wet out the carbon layup under vacuum to avoid surface imperfections such as pinholes and voids. See more about this in the carbon test projects.
