                        This is more of a manufacturing process test rather than a project, but the idea here is to get some basic knowledge of simple composite manufacturing. I started by designing a simple model of a small boat, I designed the model in Fusion 360 and then created a simple negative mold from it. After completing a draft angle analysis on the mold, I decided to print it out and give it a go. I didnâ€™t make the surface quality of the mold as smooth as it could be to deliberately test how much I could get away with, in the surface skin epoxy of the final product (wet sanding to smooth). With this in mind I continued with my normal print settings and began to prep the mold once printed. I started by using a release agent to treat the mold surface. After a couple of coats, I cut some carbon twill into the appropriate sizes and began to mix the epoxy. For this test I went with a hand laminated wet lay up into the mold. First wetting the surface of the mold with epoxy and then working the carbon fiber into that epoxy. After the layers had been applied, I applied a layer of peel ply for a uniform back finish to the part, and then some material to absorb the excess epoxy. After the above is completed, I placed the entire mold into a vacuum bag and slowly pulled a vacuum, while making sure all of the material was consolidated into the crevasses of the mold, reducing the chance of bridging occurring between the steeper angles of the mold and the carbon fiber. After a 24hr cure at room temperature, I released the vacuum and de bagged the part. The part separated from the mold with relative ease thanks to the release agent and draft analysis, and the peel ply made it a breeze to remove the waste material from the back of the part, leaving a uniform perforated finish, ideal for bonding.

                        After trimming the part with a Dremel, I started to focus on experimenting with the surface finish. I know adding a thinner topcoat of epoxy is an option to smooth out the surface, but in the interest of speed of manufacturing and lightness I decided to try to wet sand the surface down to improve the quality. This worked very well, although you can still see some surface imperfections such as pin holes, the aesthetic appeal to the part is much better. The small pin holes and other imperfections would be rectified by infusing the resin into the part under vacuum, instead of a hand layup. This process would allow you to go straight to a UV resistant clear coat, saving time and cost in the process. The overall strength and stiffness of the part is fantastic considering how light it is.
