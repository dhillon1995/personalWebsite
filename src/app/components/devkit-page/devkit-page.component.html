                        This development kit was not a meticulously planned out project, rather a project that matured over time with changing requirements. Initially I started out with a simple ‘sled’ like design that allowed me to mount both the raspberry pi and screen in a more convenient way. I got away with the rudimentary design at the time as I was using a much simpler USB Can-Bus device.

                        As the project matured, I switched to a more robust Can-Bus hat that attaches to the top of the raspberry pi. This board included a MCP2515 CAN controller and MCP2551 CAN transceiver which allowed me to interface with the OBDII port by making requests to get data and make changes, as well as having the ability to attach directly to the vehicles various CAN buses using the Tx Rx pair, and receiving packets that way. This meant that I was going to need a slightly better development kit to house the components and make it easier for me to test my code in the car.

                        The second version of the kit worked well, there were minor improvements that could’ve been made, but overall, it did the job. The only real problem I faced with this version was due to the material I used to print it. I used PLA, which under normal prototyping scenarios is fine, but after being left in the car during a warm and sunny day the devkit began to melt, this is because the glass transition temperature of PLA can be as low as 50 degrees Celsius. I rectified this by getting some high quality PETG with a much higher GTT of around 80 degrees.

                        As I was going to print a new dev kit anyway, I decided to make another design iteration. This one would include a more refined, lighter and quicker to print backplane for the pi to mount to. A slimmer more robust outer shell, and a thinner, webbed and ribbed rear cover for more rigidity and strength. This iteration was the one I was happy with, because of its modular design it allowed me to quickly print new pieces such as a new back plane for the new version of the pi. Allowing me to change major components with minimal time penalties. 
                        I also designed and printed a desk stand for the dev kit so it can sit on my desk when I’m testing UI layouts or other automation projects at my desk.
